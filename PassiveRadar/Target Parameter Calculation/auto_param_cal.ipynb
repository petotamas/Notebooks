    "# Automatic Target Parameter Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, passive bistatic radars are able to measure the bistatic range, and the bistatic Doppler shift of the  reflected signals. In case the radar utilize phased array antenna system, the measurement of the azimuth and elevation angles are also become possible. Of course the direct calculation of these quantities is rather straightforward. There exists simple formulas, which are widely available in the literature [Willis2005].  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this report I am going to summarize the basic equations, that could be used to determine these quantities from standard geodetic data. Beside this I am introducing a simple python based script which implements these calculations. This function could be usefull at many points of a system development. To check the basic operation of a syetem, to estimate its accuracy, to implement automatic performance evaluation environments based on real measurmemts, to automatically generate reference data for algorithm tuning and even to automatically generate large amount of training data from measurement to train AI algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples for all these applications will be presented in the second part of this report. \n",

    "## Bistatic range calculation: \n",
    "\n",
    "Bistatic range is the path difference of the reflected signal and the direct signal. It can be calculated with the following formula \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "R_b = R_r + R_t - L\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $R_t$ and $R_r$ are the transmitter to target and the receiver to target distances respectively. $L$ denotes the baseline distance, which is the illuminator to receiver distance. The bistatic distance has major importance, as the radar can primary determine this quantity from the measurement. From a range-Doppler map (cross-correlation detector output) one can measure the time delay between the direct path signal and target reflection by locating the correlation peak corresponding to the target.  \n",
    "In case the difference in range cells is K, then the bistatic range is simply: \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "R_b = Kc/fs,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $c$ is the speed of light and $f_s$ is the sampling frequency. In the opposite case, if we know the exact location of the IoO, the receiver and the target we can calculate the observable bistatic range. Let us assume, that all the coordinates are in lattitude, longitude, elevation format. To calculate distances (and later projections for the Doppler frequency) we can convert these coordinates into a 3D cartesian coordinate system. The forward conversion is rather straightforward, but to use Datums as well like WGS84 I have utilised the ECEF converter of the Pygeodesy module [Brouwers2020]. "
